iVisualPyODE
============

VisualPyODE is a framework library to aid in using PyODE and Visual Python together.  When you create
objects they have both physical and visual properties.  Supports collision, assemblies, and comes
with some helpful enhanced joints to simplify creating your visualized simulation.  I have implemented
the PyODE tutorial demo programs using the library so you can see exactly how to use it.  There are also
a few extra demos that go beyond the tutorial.
